# 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography Project using Python

A Python-based steganography tool that enables users to hide and retrieve secret messages within image files. This project utilizes OpenCV for image processing and offers a user-friendly GUI for seamless interaction.

## 🔑 Features

- 🔐 **Encryption & Decryption**: Hide text messages inside images and extract them securely.
- 🖼️ **Image Processing**: Leverages OpenCV for efficient image manipulation.
- 🖥️ **Graphical User Interface**: Built with Tkinter for an intuitive user experience.
- 🗂️ **Modular Codebase**: Organized into separate scripts for encryption (`Encryption.py`), decryption (`Decryption.py`), and GUI (`tool_gui.py`).

## 🧰 Requirements

Ensure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install tkinter

## Repository Structure
**Encryption.py**: Script to embed secret messages into images.

**Decryption.py**: Script to extract hidden messages from images.

**tool_gui.py**: GUI application for user interaction.

**mypic.jpg**: Sample image file for testing.
